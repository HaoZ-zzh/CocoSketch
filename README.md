# CocoSketch: High-Performance Sketch-based Measurement over Arbitrary Partial Key Query

## Introduction

**CocoSketch** is a sketch-based algorithm supporting **arbitrary partial key query**. It casts arbitrary partial key queries to the subset sum estimation problem and makes the theoretical tools for subset sum estimation practical. To realize desirable resource-accuracy tradeoffs in software and hardware platforms, we propose two techniques: (1) stochastic variance minimization to significantly reduce per-packet update delay, and (2) removing circular dependencies in the per-packet update logic to make the implementation hardware-friendly. We implement CocoSketch on four popular platforms (CPU, Open vSwitch, P4, and FPGA) and show that compared to baselines that use traditional single-key sketches, CocoSketch improves average packet processing throughput by 27.2× and accuracy by 10.4× when measuring six flow keys.
